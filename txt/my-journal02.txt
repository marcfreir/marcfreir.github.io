#### $ This is about understanding $

$ Sometimes I feel overlooked by some beings. This is a repeated dynamic, many times about speaking but not being seen. Even when I am present, I'm not included. It's incredibly frustrating, and over time, it wore on my sense of worth. So many times putting in the effort to engage, and it's met with indifference or some kind of selective attention.$

#### $ Selective reinforcement $

$  "I have to prove my potential, no matter what." This is a burden I carry almost every day. This is almost the same as "I'm not enough." $

$ I started to notice this kind of patterns, but felt useless. $

#### $ The Anagram Challenge Video $

$ I have watched a video about an this anagram experiment, and that resonated on early experiences I had. The video is about a teacher who deliver these lists of anagrams to the students. There are 3 anagrams in each paper sheet. She asks to the students to solve the anagrams, and on the right side, about half of the students raise their hands after they solved the first anagram, which was "BAT", so it becomes "TAB". The other half of the students, they didn't get it at all. So the teacher continued with the challenge. She asked again who solved the second anagram, which was "LEMON", and it becomes "MELON", and again, half of the students raised their hands, while the other half didn't. The students which didn't raise their hands started to feel confused and looked at the other students which raised their hands. The teacher continued to the next anagram, and again, just the same half of the students raised their hands. This last one seemed a little more difficult, which was "CINERAMA", and after solved it becomes "AMERICAN", and again, the same half of the students raised their hands, while the other half, just a few raised their hands. After this, the teacher reveled something. She said that the first two anagrams of the half students from the right were different from the anagrams on the list of the other half of the students, and only the third anagram was the same. Also, she said that the two anagrams on the list of the half students that almost didn't raise their hands, those two anagrams were unsolvable. In the video you can hear someone saying "whaaaaaat?". And then, comes the revelation. The teacher said that she could be able to induce something called "Learned Helplessness" to the students. The idea is very simple: when you face an challenge at first, and you can't solve it, and then, another challenge appears, and again, you can't solve it, when the next comes, even if it is sovable, you probably will not solve that, due to the frustrations from the last challenges. $

$ This is how trauma (especially emotional trauma) endure and become the lens through which we interpret the present moment. The experiences from childhood seem to shape how we see the world on the next years ahead. $

$ I didn't know this therm before, i.e., "Learned Helplessness", which means when past failures make us to anticipate the future ones. I tried to understand another therm, but it's still confusing to me, the "Imposter Syndrome". But what I could understand, it is close to this scenario. $
